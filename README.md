wordie game:

Challanges:
- some challanges I faced in my code is the popUp for the rules, At first I wanted it to be the first thing on the screen but I couldn't work it out so I found a tutorial which helped my with having a button that shows and closes the popup, However the code in the video wasn't working for my website so I had to do some quick thinking, I first search on google to try and find out what the error meant and how to fix it, I then went to chat gpt as a resource which helped me find another way which wouldn;t result in an error.

Things I learned:
- coding this project has helped me out a lot, I have been interested in web development and that Is the field I want to focus on career wise, so doing this web game has allowed me to overcome my intimidation regarding HTML, CSS, and Java-Script. I feel comfortable with the languages and was able to take what I learned in the tutorials and chat gpt to create new things on my own. I am also very proud of myself for completing this, before I has such high achievements but I was able to make a product which I am happy with.
